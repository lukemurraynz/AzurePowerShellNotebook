### What is a notebook?

A notebook is an interactive programming and computational file that supports mixing executable code, visualizations, equations, and narrative text. Contrary to scripts that need to be run in their entirety, notebooks have code cells that allow code to be run in an incremental and segmented manner. Popularized by the open-source Project Jupyter, you may have heard of these referred to as ‘Jupyter Notebooks’. The component responsible for running code in a notebook is a kernel, and traditionally, Jupyter Notebooks have been most commonly used with Python kernels. Their ability to quickly iterate on code and create visualizations with narrative text has led them to become the de facto tool for data science and great tools for teaching or learning a new programming language, and quick prototyping.

*It is important to note that Polyglot Notebooks in VS Code are powered by .NET Interactive, which is an innovative engine built using .NET technology that can run multiple languages and share variables between them. Since it is capable of behaving as a kernel in the context of notebooks, .NET Interactive lights up the Polyglot Notebooks experience.

The [Polyglot Notebooks extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/polyglot) in VS Code currently supports the following languages with more to come:

* C#
* F#
* PowerShell
* JavaScript
* HTML*
* Mermaid*
* SQL
* KQL (Kusto Query Language)

*Variable sharing not available*

*For example, developers using Polyglot Notebooks in VS Code today can connect to and query a Microsoft SQL Server database, share the tabular result to JavaScript, and create visualizations all within the same tool and the same notebook.*
